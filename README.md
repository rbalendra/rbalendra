## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I’ll showcase data analytics projects, providing a brief overview of the technology stack used to address each case.

### Property Analysis 🏘️
**Technology:** Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Server Intergration Services, SQL Server Reporting Services, T-SQL, Visual Student, Microsoft Power BI

**Skills:** ETL processes, data cleaning, star schema or Snow Flake design, SSIS package development, SSRS report creation, parameterized reporting, data aggregation, SQL querying, lookup transformations, handling data duplication.

**Description:** This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive data warehouse solution for analyzing property values and crime statistics across various suburbs and cities in Australia. The project leverages SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for reporting. The key tasks include integrating data from various sources, cleaning and transforming it to ensure accuracy, and building reports that allow users to analyze house values, crime incidents, and other metrics by geographic location.

**Results:** A fully operational data warehouse with well-structured dimension and fact tables, SSIS packages that efficiently load and transform data, and SSRS reports that enable detailed analysis of property values and crime statistics by state, city, and suburb.
