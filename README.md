## Portfolio Projects  
In this section, I‚Äôll showcase data analytics projects, providing a brief overview of the technology stack used to address each case.

### Property Analysis
**Technology:** Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Server Intergration Services, SQL Server Reporting Services, T-SQL, Visual Student, Microsoft Power BI

**Skills:** ETL processes, data cleaning, star schema or Snow Flake design, SSIS package development, SSRS report creation, parameterized reporting, data aggregation, SQL querying, lookup transformations, handling data duplication.

**Description:** This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive data warehouse solution for analyzing property values and crime statistics across various suburbs and cities in Australia. The project leverages SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for reporting. The key tasks include integrating data from various sources, cleaning and transforming it to ensure accuracy, and building reports that allow users to analyze house values, crime incidents, and other metrics by geographic location.

**Results:** A fully operational data warehouse with well-structured dimension and fact tables, SSIS packages that efficiently load and transform data, and SSRS reports that enable detailed analysis of property values and crime statistics by state, city, and suburb.

### Customer Churn Analysis

**Technology:** Microsoft Power BI 

**Skills:** Data Check --> Explore Data --> Analyse & Visualise Data --> Dashboarding --> Communicate Insights.
Formulating Calculated Columns & Measures using DAX

**Description:** As a data analyst, my primary objective was to uncover insights into customer churn and understand the factors contributing to it. The dataset, provided by a telecom company named Databel, required in-depth analysis to identify patterns of customer attrition, also known as churn. Churn refers to the rate at which customers cease doing business with a company. Given that retaining customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, reducing churn is a critical priority for many organizations. This project involved detailed data analysis to provide actionable insights that could help the company proactively address customer churn and enhance retention strategies.

**Steps taken:** 
1. Perform a Datacheck
2. Ask yourself different business questions and explore the Data
3. Discover insights and visualise them using suitable visualisation
4. Build a dashboard or story so you can cohesively share the information
5. Organise a session with stakeholders and walk them through the dashboard or story

The insights dashboard summarizes the customer service experience by analyzing customer service calls, extra charges, and their relationship with churn. It includes a geographic breakdown of customer service calls and churn by state, offering a comprehensive view of how service quality affects retention.

This is the breakdown of customer churn by age groups, showing the churn rate and number of customers in each age bracket. It also compares the average monthly charge and churn rate across different customer age groups, revealing how age and monthly charges influence customer retention.

This dashboard analyzes churn rates based on account length and contract types, while also considering customer service calls. The report provides a detailed view of churn by contract length and compares the average account length and churn rate across different contract types and payment methods.

This focuses on the impact of extra charges on customer churn, highlighting the churn rate based on unlimited data plans and grouped data consumption categories. It provides insights into how extra data and international charges contribute to overall customer churn.
