## Portfolio Projects  
In this section, I’ll showcase data analytics projects, providing a brief overview of the technology stack used to address each case.

### Property Analysis
**Technology:** Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Server Intergration Services, SQL Server Reporting Services, T-SQL, Visual Student, Microsoft Power BI

**Skills:** ETL processes, data cleaning, star schema or Snow Flake design, SSIS package development, SSRS report creation, parameterized reporting, data aggregation, SQL querying, lookup transformations, handling data duplication.

**Description:** This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive data warehouse solution for analyzing property values and crime statistics across various suburbs and cities in Australia. The project leverages SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for reporting. The key tasks include integrating data from various sources, cleaning and transforming it to ensure accuracy, and building reports that allow users to analyze house values, crime incidents, and other metrics by geographic location.

**Results:** A fully operational data warehouse with well-structured dimension and fact tables, SSIS packages that efficiently load and transform data, and SSRS reports that enable detailed analysis of property values and crime statistics by state, city, and suburb.

### Customer Churn Analysis (Case Study)

**Technology:** Microsoft Power BI

**Skills:** Data Check --> Explore Data --> Analyse & Visualise Data --> Dashboarding --> Communicate Insights 

**Description:** As a data analyst, my primary objective was to uncover insights into customer churn and understand the factors contributing to it. The dataset, provided by a telecom company named Databel, required in-depth analysis to identify patterns of customer attrition, also known as churn. Churn refers to the rate at which customers cease doing business with a company. Given that retaining customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, reducing churn is a critical priority for many organizations. This project involved detailed data analysis to provide actionable insights that could help the company proactively address customer churn and enhance retention strategies.

**Steps taken:** 
1. Perform a Datacheck
2. Ask yourself different business questions and explore the Data
3. Discover insights and visualise them using suitable visualisation
4. Build a dashboard or story so you can cohesively share the information
5. Organise a session with stakeholders and walk them through the dashboard or story
